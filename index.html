        <h2 class="aboutMe" id="about">About:</h2>
        <p>My name is Lihle Naphakade, I was born on the 24-Oct-1995. I am currently working as a Customer Solutions
            Specialist at Impact. I have studied Business Management at Boland college, I also completed two short
            courses at the North-West University in Behavioural and Organisational Skills and Workplace Relations. In
            20188, I was part of a BootCamp where I learned full stack Software Development howeve I had to quit due to
            financial challenges.</p>
        <br>At Codex, I learned and practically applied these skills:
        <ul>
            <li>Using the Linux terminal to manage and install software</li>
            <li>Building responsive websites using HTML & CSS</li>
            <li>Test Driven Development using mocha & Travis CI</li>
            <li>Version control using Git & GitHub</li>
            <li>Creating interactive front-ends using the DOM with JavaScript.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I have been involved in many extra mural activities aimed at developing my confidence, verbal communication
            and team working skills. Whilst at college I have been heavily involved in my Church through my Youth Group.
            Being a part of these group has had a great impact in my life and has helped me make wise decisions and
            realize the potential I have to ensure my dreams become a reality. The youth today are exposed to a lot of
            things good and bad, but by committing myself to this group I have expanded my horizons and am determined to
            create a successful life which I can be proud of.</p>
